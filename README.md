# ES-DE Android App Covers

Welcome to the ES-DE Android App Cover repository! This repository provides a collection of over 200 high-quality covers for the most frequently used apps among handheld gamers. These include high-resolution covers in PNG format for every major Android emulator, video streaming service, audio streaming service, gaming streaming service, and most commonly used utilities like VPNs and File Explorers.

## Usage
To start using these covers, simply download the images you want and drop them in your following path:

``` ~/ES-DE/downloaded_media/androidapps/covers ```

*Note: If you have renamed your app or game in ES-DE, you will have to rename the cover to the exact same filename, minus the extension.*

## Features
- **High Quality Images:** Each cover is meticulously crafted and exported in Lossless PNG format offering excellent visual clarity and consistency across covers.
- **Curated Collection:** Don't dig through mountains of Steam Grid trash. This collection has everything you need and nothing you don't
- **Free to Use:** All covers in this repository are completely free for personal use.

## Roadmap
- **Square Covers:** I prefer the 720P banner format personally, but the beauty of ES-DE is you can customize it to your liking. 1:1 versions coming soon!
- **Android Games:** This will take awhile to complete, but I'm committed to eventually adding a complete library of covers for the best games available on Android.
- **Screenshots & Marquees:** Lower priority, but I know some folks love the miximage format. Will get to this eventually!

## Feedback and Request
If you have any questions, suggestions, or need support, please don't hesitate to open an issue in this repository.

Got a request? Happy to fulfill any reasonable requests from the community!  Just make sure the app meets the threshold of being useful for handheld gamers on Android.
